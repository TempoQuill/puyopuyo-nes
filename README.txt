This is an extremely work-in-progress disassembly of the cartridge version of Puyo Puyo (FC), made for the express purpose of later converting to Pac-Attack.  Hacking is ill-advised.  You can build it however.

How to build:

Go to the command line, follow the directory your clone is in, and type "build".
